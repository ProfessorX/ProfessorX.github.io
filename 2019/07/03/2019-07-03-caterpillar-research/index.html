<h2 id="CAT-Rental"><a href="#CAT-Rental" class="headerlink" title="CAT Rental"></a>CAT Rental</h2><p>It’s no secret that most of us spend a lot of time online, including shopping and researching products. Customers worldwide demand easy, convenient desktop and mobile solutions. Combine that with a growing, competitive rental industry, and you get the need for a top-notch online presence. That’s where the new CatRentalStore.com and mobile app come in.</p>
<p><strong>Fun facts: More people own cell phones than toothbrushes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The average person spends more than 3.3 hours on their phone every day.</strong></p>

<p>“Your company needs to optimize its online presence for mobile users - it is absolutely vital. It’s what will drive customer connectivity, trust and communication. It’s what will compel those customers to take action, to connect with you, to make a purchase and to move forward.” - Jim Kreyenhagen for Forbes</p>
<p><strong>Equipment rental revenue opportunity globally is about $90 Bn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The rental industry is growing by about 5% CAGR each year.</strong></p>
<p>“Customers want an easy solution <strong>at their fingertips</strong> for <strong>everything they’re doing</strong>, including renting through the Cat Rental Store. It’s critical that we get this right.” - GRUES Director Kurt Norris</p>

That’s where people start when they have a problem to solve. Customers want an easy solution at their fingertips for <strong>everything</strong> they’re doing, including renting through the Cat Rental Store. It’s critical that we get this right.”</p>

<h4 id="Parts"><a href="#Parts" class="headerlink" title="Parts"></a>Parts</h4><p>Looking for 24/7 access to information on the Cat® parts, tools and materials you need to get the job done? We offer two options to buy parts online.</p>
<p>Introducing the new myParts.Cat.Com site. Buy genuine Cat filters, engine parts and other common maintenance, wear, and repair parts for your Cat equipment online, delivered right to your door.</p>
<p>Cat® Air Conditioner Kits are specifically designed to retrofit your existing Cat equipment.</p>
<p>The reliability of your truck and automated equipment begins with a reliable battery. You need to have confidence that your battery will start your equipment every time, even in the most adverse environments and extreme temperatures. The best way to assure your commercial equipment and automotive vehicle will start is to install Cat® Premium High Output, General Service Line or Uninterruptible Power Supply batteries that are manufactured to Caterpillar’s high quality standards.</p>
<p>As a global leader for over 85 years, Caterpillar provides the highly competitive belt technology and options suitable to be used on products for all industries we support. Cat® Belts are manufactured and tested for ideal traction, speed and long service life on Cat machines to prevent slippage and alignment problems.</p>
<p>Two Cat® cab types are available and both are offered as “Plug-and-Play” options that are fully assembled and ready to install on the machine.</p>
<p>CATERPILLAR’S MACHINE REBUILD PROGRAM OFFERS SAME QUALITY AS NEW CAT® MACHINE<br>The Cat® Certified Rebuild Program offers a like-new machine with a like-new warranty and a new serial number, all at a fraction of the cost of a comparable new machine. The program starts with a complete machine inspection. Then the machine is completely disassembled and rebuilt from the ground up to include all Cat product updates. More than 350 tests and inspections (plus the automatic replacement of more than 7,000 parts) ensure the same high level of quality as a new Cat machine.</p>
<p>THE RIGHT AFTERMARKET PARTS FOR YOUR MACHINE AND BUDGET<br>Get the right fit for your machine and budget with Yellowmark™, a Caterpillar brand. This line of heavy equipment parts for your Cat® machines strikes the right balance between convenience and reliability at more affordable price.</p>

<li>Cat COMMAND for Dozing is a remote control ready dozing option that contributes to jobsite safety by allowing operators to run a bulldozer remotely in hazardous mining and earthmoving applications. Optional COMMAND for Dozing is deeply integrated with Cat machine systems to enable smooth, precise control for maximum efficiency and productivity. Operate the machine using an over-the-shoulder operator console or from a comfortable remote operator station.</li>
<li>When used in a potentially hazardous application, remote control allows the operator to dig, lift, and track from a safe working distance.</li>
<li>Wheel loaders operating in mining and quarry &amp; aggregates applications face a number of potentially dangerous areas, such as high walls, stockpiles, steep slopes, unstable surfaces and areas where there are hazardous materials or the possibility of falling debris. Cat® Command for loading on the 988K Wheel Loader is a line-of-sight remote control system which removes operators from potentially hazardous situations. Command for loading on the 988K uses wireless technology and on-board electronic systems to allow the machines to be controlled without an operator in the cab.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cat® Compact technologies combine advanced compaction measurement, in-cab guidance and reporting capabilities to help you consistently meet compaction targets faster, more uniformly, and in fewer passes—saving on fuel and reducing rework and material costs in both soil and asphalt applications.</p>
<p>On the surface, operators in the cabs of large mining equipment often cannot see if another machine or vehicle is too close for safe operation. Detect helps alleviate this potential safety hazard and can also be configured to provide valuable information about site conditions and other assets working in the area. Underground, continuous equipment movement on a longwall face can pose risks to those in the working area.</p>
<p>Cat® Grade technologies combine <strong>digital design data, in-cab guidance, and automatic controls</strong> to enhance grading accuracy, reduce rework, and lower costs related to production earthmoving and rough, fine and finish grade applications.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working on simple planes and slopes or complex contour designs, Grade technologies enable you to boost grading efficiency by as much as 50%, helping you get more work done – in less time and at a lower cost – than ever before.</p>
