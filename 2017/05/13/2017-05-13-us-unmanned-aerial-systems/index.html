        <p>This post is an excerpt and summary of U.S. Congressinoal Research<br>Service report <strong>R42136</strong>. I put my own comments in the lines to show how stupid<br>the United Statesd Department of Defense is, and will be.</p>
<p>Unmanned aerial systems comprise a <strong>rapidly growing</strong> portion of the<br>military budget, and have been a <strong>long-term interest</strong> of Congress. At<br>times, Congress has encouraged the development of such systems; in<br>other instances, it has attempted to <strong>rein</strong> in or better organize the<br>Department of Defense’s efforts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHAT, HOW AND WHY ARE THE TOP 3 QUESTIONS EVERY UAS MANUFACTURER<br>SHOULD ASK HERSELF.</p>
</blockquote>
<span id="more"></span>

<blockquote>
<p>No money, no UAS. That’s it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>content<br>{:toc}</li>
</ul>
<p>Unmanned aircraft are commonly called unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),<br>and when combined with <strong>ground control stations and data links</strong>, form<br>UAS, or unmanned aerial systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Full automation, it’s still a dream. (My friends are talking about<br>salary and social security now, it’s a joke in my company, namely,<br><strong>Shaoyang Sunshine</strong>. LOL.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UAVs range from the size of an insect to that of a commercial<br>airliner. DOD currently possesses five UAVs in <strong>large numbers</strong>: the Air<br>Force’s <strong>Predator, Reaper, and Global Hawk</strong>; and the Army’s Hunter and<br>Shadow. Other key UAV developmental efforts include the Air Force’s<br>RQ-170 Sentinel; the Navy’s Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne<br>Surveillance and Strike (<strong>UCLASS</strong>), MQ-8 <strong>Fire Scout</strong>, and Broad Area<br>Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAV; and the Marine Corps’s Small<br>Tactical Unmanned Aerial System.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>蓝海海军，任重而道远。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, reflecting the growing awareness and support in Congress and<br>the Department of Defense for UAS, <strong>investments</strong> in unmanned aerial<br>vehicles have been <strong>increasing</strong> every year. DOD spending on UAS has<br>increased from $284 million in FY2000 to $3.3 billion in FY2010.</p>
<blockquote>

<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>UAVs are either described as a single air vehicle (with associated<br>surveillance sensors), or a UAV system (UAS), which usually consists<br>of three to six air vehicles, <strong>a ground control station</strong>, and<br><strong>support</strong> equipment.</p>
<p>UAS <strong>may</strong> also be <strong>cheaper</strong> to procure and operate than manned<br>aircraft. However, the lower procurement cost of UAS can be weighed<br>against their <strong>greater proclivity to crash</strong>, while the minimized risk to<br>onboard crew can be weighed against the <strong>complications and hazards<br>inherent</strong> in flying unmanned vehicles in airspace shared with manned assets.</p>

<p>UAS use has increased for a number of reasons. Advanced <strong>navigation and<br>communications</strong> technologies were not available just a few years ago,<br>and increases in military communications <strong>satellite bandwidth</strong> have made<br>remote operation of UAS more practical. The nature of the Iraq and<br>Afghanistan wars has also increased the demand for UAS, as<br>identification of and strikes against targets hiding among civilian<br>populations required <strong>persistent surveillance</strong> and prompt strike<br>capability, to minimize collateral damage. Further, UAS provide an<br>asymmetrical—and <strong>comparatively invulnerable—technical advantage</strong> in<br>these conflicts.</p>

By performing tasks<br>such as <strong>surveillance; signals intelligence</strong> (SIGINT); precision target<br>designation; mine detection; and chemical, biological, radiological,<br>nuclear (CBRN) reconnaissance, unmanned systems have made key<br>contributions to the <strong>Global War on Terror</strong>.</p>

<p>Unmanned aircraft systems are usually less expensive than manned<br>aircraft. <strong>Initial concepts</strong> envisioned very <strong>low-cost, essentially<br>expendable aircraft</strong>. As of 2011, however, whether substantially lower<br>costs will be realized is unclear. Although a pilot may not be on<br>board, the <strong>advanced sensors</strong> carried by unmanned aircraft systems are<br>very expensive and cannot be viewed as expendable…. Moreover,<br><strong>excessively high losses</strong> of aircraft can negate cost advantages by<br>requiring the services to purchase large numbers of <strong>replacement</strong><br>aircraft.</p>

UAS are<br>therefore still in a period of <strong>innovation</strong>, both in their design and<br>how they are operated. This can be seen as analogous to military<br>aircraft in the 1930s and 1940s, when <strong>technologies and doctrines</strong><br>evolved at a rapid rate to exploit the new technology, and also to the<br>early Jet Age, when the military acquired many different models of<br>aircraft with varying capabilities before settling on a force made up<br>of large numbers of relatively few models based on lessons learned.</p>

Development of UAS is still carried out by individual<br>military services.</p>
<p>A significant congressional boost to UAS acquisition came in the<br>conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for<br>Fiscal Year 2001, which expressed Congress’s desire that “within ten<br>years, <strong>one-third</strong> of U.S. military operational deep strike aircraft<br>will be unmanned.” 31 This goal was seen at the time as very<br>challenging, because DOD had no unmanned deep strike aircraft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the U.S. military failed.<br>Subsequently, the Fiscal 2007 Defense Authorization Act required the<br>Secretary of Defense to “develop a policy, to be applicable<br>throughout the Department of Defense, on research, development, test<br>and evaluation, procurement, and operation of unmanned systems.” The<br>policy was required to include, among other elements, “A preference<br>for unmanned systems in acquisition programs for new systems,<br>including a requirement under any such program for the development of<br>a manned system for a certification that an unmanned system is<br><strong>incapable</strong> of meeting program requirements.” Thus, Congress changed<br>the <strong>default assumption</strong> of new systems; instead of seeking unmanned<br>systems to accomplish the same tasks as manned equivalents, unmanned<br>systems would be developed to accomplish military tasks <strong>unless</strong> there<br>was some need that the systems be manned.</p>

According to DOD’s most recent estimate, the Global<br>Hawk program will cost <strong>$13.9 billion to purchase 66 aircraft</strong>; a<br>program acquisition unit cost of $211 million per UAV. 33 The program<br>has twice triggered Nunn-McCurdy breaches, which require DOD to notify<br>Congress when cost growth on a major acquisition program reaches<br>15%. In 2005, development cost overruns led to an average unit cost<br>growth of 18% per airframe and prompted appropriators to voice their<br>concern (H.R. 2863, H.Rept. 109-119, p. 174). In April 2011, a<br>reduction in the number of Global Hawk Block 40 aircraft requested in<br>the FY2012 budget from 22 to 11 caused overall Global Hawk unit prices<br>to increase by 11%, again triggering Nunn-McCurdy.</p>

<h3 id="UAS-and-Investment-Priorities"><a href="#UAS-and-Investment-Priorities" class="headerlink" title="UAS and Investment Priorities"></a>UAS and Investment Priorities</h3><p>As part of its defense oversight role, Congress is positioned to<br>arbitrate between <strong>competing</strong> UAS investments, or impact DOD’s<br>overarching investment plan. Several relevant questions seem apparent:<br>How is UAS cost <strong>quantified</strong>? What is the most <em>effective</em> balance in<br>spending <strong>between UAS and manned aircraft</strong>? How should DOD, Congress,<br>and the UAS manufacturers balance cost with <strong>apability</strong>? Finally, what<br><strong>areas</strong> of investment are the most important to maximize UAS<br>capabilities?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>好钢用在刀刃上。Human have always been greedy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When compared to other aircraft, the cost of an individual remotely<br>piloted vehicle can be <strong>misleading</strong>. UAVs operate as part of a system,<br>which generally consists of a <strong>ground control station</strong>, a ground crew<br>including <strong>remote pilots and sensor operators, communication links</strong>, and<br>often multiple air vehicles. Unlike a manned aircraft such as an F-16,<br>these supporting elements are a <strong>requisite</strong> for the vehicle’s<br>flight. Consequently, analysts comparing UAV costs to manned<br>aircraft may need to consider the cost of the supporting elements and<br>operational infrastructure that <strong>make up the complete</strong> unmanned aviation<br>system.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Once an adequate and uniform cost comparison mechanism or definition has been established, the<br>next step for Congress may be to identify an <strong>appropriate balance</strong> in spending between UAS and<br>manned aircraft. If the upward trend in UAS funding continues through 2013, as shown in Figure<br>3, DOD is projected to have spent upwards of $26 billion on procurement, RDT&amp;E, operations,<br>and maintenance for UAS from <strong>2001-2013</strong>. This number far exceeds the <strong>$3.9 billion</strong> spent on<br>UAS from 1988-2000.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Cost savings</strong> have long been touted by UAS advocates as one of the advantages offered by<br>unmanned aircraft over manned aircraft. However, critics point out that the acquisition cost<br>savings are <strong>often negligible</strong> if one considers that money saved by not having a pilot in the cockpit<br>must be applied to the <strong>“ground cockpit”</strong> of the UAS aircrew operating the UAV from the ground<br>control station. Another cost question concerns personnel. Do UAS “pilots” cost less to train and<br>keep proficient than pilots of manned aircraft?  So although the air vehicle <strong>might</strong> be cheaper than<br>a manned aircraft, the UAV system as a whole is <strong>not always</strong> less expensive. Additionally, UAS<br>have <strong>a higher attrition rate and lower reliability rate</strong> than manned aircraft, which means that the<br>operation and maintenance costs can be higher. On the other hand, UAS ground control stations<br>are capable of simultaneously flying multiple UAVs, somewhat restoring the advantage in cost to<br>the unmanned system. Congress has noted that, “while the acquisition per unit cost may be<br>relatively small, <strong>in the aggregate</strong>, the acquisition cost rivals the investment in other larger weapon<br>systems.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>吹牛逼最革命！战略家负责指挥，然后底层的工程师们说：只差一个程序员了，<br>吼不吼啊！</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A second approach advocates fielding fewer, <strong>more expensive</strong>, and <strong>more capable</strong> UAVs that are<br>less networked with other systems, such as the autonomous Global Hawk. The Global Hawk<br>serves as a high altitude, “all-in-one” surveillance platform capable of staying aloft for days at a<br>time, yet does not operate in concert with any of its fellow UAV peers. Since 2003, programs at<br>both ends of this spectrum have experienced delays and a reduction in funding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>全球鹰，美利坚军部重金求子的产物。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, what <strong>areas of investment</strong> will yield the maximum effectiveness out of these UAS? Four<br>specific issues stand out as the most pressing: <strong>interoperability, reliability, force<br>multiplication/autonomy, and engine systems</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>

<h4 id="Interoperability"><a href="#Interoperability" class="headerlink" title="Interoperability"></a>Interoperability</h4><p>UAS development has been marked by the <strong>slow advancement</strong> of interoperability. The future plans<br>for UAS use within the framework of larger battlefield operations and more <strong>interconnected</strong> and<br>potentially joint-service combat systems require UAS to <strong>communicate seamlessly</strong> between each<br>other and numerous <strong>different</strong> ground components, and to also be <strong>compatible</strong> with diverse ground<br>control systems. The lack of interconnectivity at these levels has often complicated missions to<br>the point of <strong>reducing their effectiveness</strong>, as Dyke Weatherington, head of DOD’s UAS planning<br>taskforce, noted: “There have been cases where a service’s UAV, if it could have gotten data to<br>another service, another component, it may have provided <strong>better situational awareness</strong> on a<br>specific threat in a specific area that might have resulted in<br><strong>different measures</strong> being taken.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, DOD hopes to integrate an adequate interface for situational awareness,<br>which will <strong>relay</strong> the objective, position, payload composition, service operator,<br>and mission tasking procedure to other <strong>unmanned aircraft</strong> and potentially to</li>
<li><em>ground elements</em>*</li>
<li>Second, a payload interface will allow the coherent transfer of<br>surveillance data.</li>
<li>Third, the weapons interface will constitute a separate transfer medium by which<br>operators can coordinate these platforms’ offensive capabilities.</li>
<li>Finally, the air vehicle <strong>control interface</strong> will enable navigation and positioning<br>from the ground with respect to other aircraft.</li>
</ul>
<p>The members of the House Armed Services Committee included a<br>clause that called for the requirement of <strong>all</strong> tactical unmanned aerial vehicles throughout the<br>services to be equipped with the <strong>Tactical Common Data Link</strong>, which has become the services’<br>standardized communication tool for providing “critical <strong>wideband</strong> data link required for real-time<br>situational awareness, as well as real time sensor and targeting data<br>to tactical commanders.”</p>
<p>The increased use of UAS in Iraq and Afghanistan indicates that remotely piloted<br>platforms’ <strong>mass consumption of bandwidth</strong> will require a more robust information transfer system<br>in the coming years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>现代战争已经证明了，军队才是真正的带宽杀手、流量杀手。KALE!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One approach to alleviating the bandwidth concern was the Transformational Satellite<br>Communications (TSAT) project. DOD intended to use that <strong>laser and satellite communications</strong><br>system to provide U.S. Armed Forces with an <strong>unlimited and uninhibited</strong> ability to send and<br>receive messages and critical information around the world without data traffic jams. However,<br>the TSAT project was canceled in 2009. As another interim option, DOD has testified that a more<br><strong>autonomous</strong> UAV would require <strong>less bandwidth</strong>, since more data are processed on board and less<br>data are being moved.  However, it is <strong>unclear</strong> that autonomy will actually decrease bandwidth<br>requirements since the transmission of data from the UAV’s sensors drives the demand for<br>bandwidth. As an example, a single Global Hawk, already an autonomous UAV, “requires<br>500Mbps bandwidth—which equates to <strong>500 percent</strong> of the total bandwidth of the entire U.S.<br>military used during the 1991 Gulf War.”</p>

<h4 id="Reliability-Safety"><a href="#Reliability-Safety" class="headerlink" title="Reliability/Safety"></a>Reliability/Safety</h4><p>A 2010 media study reported that “<strong>Thirty-eight Predator and Reaper drones</strong> have crashed during<br>combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and nine more during training on bases in the U.S.—<br>with each crash costing between <strong>$3.7 million and $5 million</strong>. Altogether, the Air Force says there<br>have been 79 drone accidents costing at least $1 million each.”</p>
<p>In 2004 the Defense Science Board indicated that relatively <strong>high UAV mishap rates</strong> might impede<br>the widespread fielding of UAVs. Although <strong>most</strong>UAV accidents have been attributed to human<br>error, 64 investment in reliability upgrades appears to be another high priority for UAS. The 2005<br>UAS <strong>Roadmap</strong> indicated that UAV mishap rates appeared to be much higher than the mishap<br>rates of many manned aircraft. Table 3 shows the number of Class A Mishaps per 100,000 hours<br>of major UAVs and comparable manned aircraft as of 2005.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/X6d9iBd.png" alt="Selected Mishape Rates"></p>
<p>In its 2004 study, the Defense Science Board (DSB) notes that manned aircraft over the past five<br>decades have moved from <strong>a relatively high mishap rate</strong> to relatively low rates through<br>advancements in <strong>system design, weather durability improvements, and reliability upgrades</strong>.</p>
<p>The DSB report also suggests that nominal <strong>upgrades and investment</strong>—arguing even that many<br>UAS will need little change—could produce <strong>substantial reductions</strong> in the UAV mishap rates. The<br>2005 UAS Roadmap proposes investments into emerging technologies, such as self-repairing<br>“smart” flight control systems, auto take-off and recovery instruments, and heavy fuel engines, to<br>enhance reliability. Also, the incorporation of <strong>advanced materials</strong>—such as high temperature<br>components, light-weight structures, shape memory alloys, and <strong>cold weather tolerance designs</strong><br>that include significant de-icing properties—will be expected to improve the survivability of UAS<br>in adverse environments.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="Force-Multiplication-Autonomy"><a href="#Force-Multiplication-Autonomy" class="headerlink" title="Force Multiplication/Autonomy"></a>Force Multiplication/Autonomy</h4><p>One of the most attractive and innovative technological priorities for UAS is to enable <strong>one<br>ground operator</strong> to pilot several UAVs at once. Currently most UAS require at least two ground<br>operators; <strong>one to pilot</strong> the vehicle and <strong>another to control the sensors</strong>. The end goal for UAS<br>manufactures and users is to reduce the 2:1 operator-vehicle ratio and eventually elevate the<br><strong>autonomy and interoperability</strong> of UAS to the point where two or more vehicles can be controlled<br>by <strong>one</strong> operator. If this technological feat is achieved, the advantage of UAS as a <strong>force-multiplier</strong><br>on the battlefield could provide a dramatic change in <strong>combat capability</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The process of achieving this goal may require significant time and investments. As the 2005<br>UAS Roadmap notes, “Getting groups of UA to <strong>team</strong> (or swarm) in order to accomplish an<br>objective will require significant investment in <strong>control technologies</strong>” with specific reference to<br><strong>distributed</strong> control technologies. Considering the two operator system currently in place for<br>most UAS, the logical approach to reaching this technological advancement is to first invest in<br>the autonomous flight capabilities of the UAVs, so as to <strong>reduce the workload</strong> for the complete<br>UAS. The Global Hawk and the Scan Eagle possess significant automated flight capabilities, but<br>their degree of actual flight autonomy can be debated due to the UAV’s need for <strong>continuous<br>operator intervention</strong> in poor weather conditions. The OSD quantifies the degree of UAV<br>autonomy on a scale of 1 to 10; Table 4 shows the OSD’s Autonomous Capability Levels for<br>UAVs.</p>

<h4 id="Engine-Systems"><a href="#Engine-Systems" class="headerlink" title="Engine Systems"></a>Engine Systems</h4><p>Some key technologies that will enable future UAS include:</p>
<p>lightweight, long endurance battery and/or alternative <strong>power technology</strong>, effective <strong>bandwidth</strong><br>management/data compression tools, stealth capability and <strong>collaborative</strong> or teaming<br>technologies that will allow UAS to operate in concert with each other and with manned<br>aircraft. A critical enabler allowing UAS access to U.S. National and ICAO airspace will be<br><strong>a robust on-board sense and avoid technology</strong>. The ability of UAS to operate in airspace<br>shared with civil manned aircraft will be critical for future <strong>peacetime training and operations</strong>.<br>There is also a need for open architecture systems that will allow competition among many<br>different commercial UAS and ground control systems allowing DoD to “<strong>mix and match</strong>”<br>the best of all possible systems on the market.

<h3 id="Duplication-of-Capability"><a href="#Duplication-of-Capability" class="headerlink" title="Duplication of Capability"></a>Duplication of Capability</h3><p>Congress may ask if the production of different UAS with relatively similar performance<br>capabilities constitutes unnecessary duplication.（<del>Sadly the answer<br>is YES</del>). Critics of expanded UAS roles often argue that the<br>production of similar platforms is unnecessary, considering that a<br><strong>consolidated</strong> inventory—hypothetically consisting of only the RQ-4B<br>Global Hawk, the RQ/MQ-1 Predator and the RQ-7 Shadow—could perform<br>and fulfill the same duties as the expanded inventory.</p>

<p>The 2011 program acquisition unit cost for the MQ-9 Reaper is <strong>$28.4 million</strong>, just over half the<br>$55 million estimate for the F-16 Falcon. A simple payload comparison shows that the F-16 can<br>carry approximately <strong>four times</strong> the payload of the Reaper (10,750 lbs vs. 2,500 lbs). Further, the<br>F-16 is a <strong>versatile combat aircraft</strong> that can be used to perform many missions that the Reaper<br>cannot. This may suggest that using manned aircraft for air-to-ground combat may generally<br>prove <strong>more cost effective</strong> than using UAS, and that the UAS’s unique combat capabilities may be<br>most valued in <strong>niche circumstances</strong>, such as when manned aircraft would be in extreme danger.</p>

<p><strong>还是那句话，理想很丰满，现实很骨感。</strong></p>
<p>Other missions for which UAS appear useful, or are being considered in the near term, include<br><strong>electronic attack</strong> (also called stand-off jamming, or escort jamming), and psychological<br>operations, such as <strong>dropping leaflets</strong> (EXO ME?!!). UAS such as the Army’s Shadow have been evaluated for<br>their capability to deliver <strong>critical medical supplies</strong> needed on<br>the battlefield.</p>
<p>While UAS use in foreign theaters is well established, one of the most commonly discussed new<br>mission areas for UAS is <strong>homeland defense and homeland security</strong>. The Coast Guard and U.S.<br>Border Patrol already employ UAS such as the Eagle Eye and Predator to watch coastal waters,<br><strong>patrol the nation’s borders</strong>, and <strong>protect major oil and gas<br>pipelines</strong> (EVEN ELECTRICITY LINES).</p>
<p>It appears that interest is growing in using UAS for a variety of domestic, and often non-defense<br>roles. <strong>Long-duration</strong> law enforcement surveillance, a task performed by manned aircraft during<br>the October 2002 sniper incident near Washington, DC, is one example. The U.S. Department of<br>Transportation has studied possible security roles for UAS, such as following trucks with<br>hazardous cargo, while the Energy Department has been developing high-altitude instruments to<br>measure radiation in the atmosphere. UAS might also be used in sparsely populated areas of the<br>western United States to search for <strong>forest fires</strong>. Following the widespread destruction of<br>Hurricane Katrina, some suggest that a UAS like Global Hawk could play roles in “<strong>consequence<br>management</strong>” and relief efforts. Also, UAS advocates note that countries like South Korea and<br>Japan have used UAS for decades for crop dusting and other agricultural purposes.</p>
<p>One drawback to these lighter-than-air platforms is their <strong>lack of maneuverability</strong> and speed relative to<br>UAVs like the Global Hawk; their long persistence once on station may be somewhat offset by<br>the time required for them to <strong>relocate</strong> in response to new taskings. Nonetheless, many major UAS<br>manufacturers are preparing—and, in some cases, testing—lighter-than-air systems that could<br>carry out a variety of missions for homeland security.</p>
<p>Space satellites offer many benefits; they are thought to be <strong>relatively invulnerable</strong> to attack, and<br>field many advanced capabilities. However, tasking the satellites can be <strong>cumbersome</strong>, especially<br>with <strong>competing national priorities</strong>. The limited number of systems can only serve so many<br>customers at one time. Additionally, some satellites lack the <strong>loitering capability</strong> of UAS, only<br>passing over the same spot on Earth about once every three days. Due to the <strong>high costs</strong> of space<br>launches, UAVs like Global Hawk are being considered for communication relays as substitutes<br>for low-orbiting satellite constellations.</p>

<h4 id="The-Issue-of-Airspace"><a href="#The-Issue-of-Airspace" class="headerlink" title="The Issue of Airspace"></a>The Issue of Airspace</h4><p>According to FAA spokesman William Shumann, the primary challenge in<br>finding this common ground is “to develop vehicles that meet FAA<br><strong>safety requirements</strong> if they want to fly in crowded airspace.”</p>
<p>Upgrading UAS collision avoidance capabilities, often referred to as “<strong>sense and<br>avoid</strong>” technology, appears to be a critical part in the next step of reaching the UAS-airspace<br>common ground.</p>
<h3 id="Recruitment-and-Retention"><a href="#Recruitment-and-Retention" class="headerlink" title="Recruitment and Retention"></a>Recruitment and Retention</h3><p>The defining characteristic of UAS is that they are “<strong>unmanned</strong>”<br>or “<strong>unpiloted</strong>.” However, this may be a <strong>misnomer</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>讲个笑话：无人机。我讲完了。真正哪天做到强人工智能了，家祭无忘告乃翁。<br><em>“There’s nothing unmanned about them,” [former Air Force Lt Gen David] Deptula said. It<br>can take as many as 170 persons to launch, fly, and maintain such an aircraft as well as to<br>process and disseminate its ISR products.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A central question related to the potential impact of increased UAS employment on personnel is<br>“<strong>what qualifications</strong> are required to operate UAS?” Currently, the Air Force requires Predator and<br>Global Hawk operators to be <strong>pilot-rated officers</strong>. Other services do not require that status for their<br>UAS operators. This means that, in the other services, there is <strong>no competition</strong> between manned<br>and unmanned aircraft for potentially scarce pilots.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The Air Force maintains that their UAS are more technologically and operationally <strong>sophisticated</strong><br>than other UAS, and a trained pilot is required to employ these UAS most effectively. As UAS<br>autonomy, or command and control, matures, or if personnel issues for the Air Force become<br>more troublesome, it, or Congress, may decide to <strong>review</strong> the policy of requiring pilot-rated<br>officers to operate UAS.</p>
<h3 id="Industrial-Base-Considerations"><a href="#Industrial-Base-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Industrial Base Considerations"></a>Industrial Base Considerations</h3><p>Those who fear manned industrial base atrophy argue that the future of UAS is <strong>overrated</strong>, and<br>that demand will continue for tactical manned aircraft in the post-JSF timeframe. In their eyes,<br>crucial skills and technologies could thus be <strong>lost</strong> by concentrating only on unmanned aircraft<br>design, possibly causing U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design to wane. These proponents<br>point out that UAS have been around for almost a century, yet only recently became <strong>operationally<br>effective</strong>, and are <strong>not likely</strong> to replace manned aircraft in the near<br>future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future is NOT overrated. What is overrated is the RESEARCH AND<br>DEVELOPMENT of Artificial Intelligence.

</blockquote>
<p>One survey finds that in 2011, there are<br><strong>680 different UAS programs</strong> worldwide, up from 195 in 2005.  Another estimates that global<br>UAS expenditures will double from $1.7 billion in 2011 to <strong>$3.5 billion in 2020</strong>.  The global<br>market for <strong>combat aircraft alone</strong>, at approximately $15.8 billion in 2011, dwarfs the UAS market.<br>But the rate of growth is projected to be much slower, peaking at approximately $21 billion in<br>2017, and dropping to approximately $19 billion in 2020.  Thus, some would argue that much<br>new business is likely to be generated in the UAS market, and if U.S. companies <strong>fail</strong> to capture<br>this market share, European, Russian, Israeli, Chinese, or <strong>South<br>African</strong>(EXO ME???)  companies will. From this perspective, capturing<br>this new business, and nurturing industrial expertise in UAS challenge<br>areas (e.g., <strong>autonomous flight</strong>, control of multiple vehicles, command<br>and control, communications bandwidth) would be an effective way to<br>keep U.S. industry competitive and healthy.</p>

The wide employment of the MQ-1 has also facilitated the development of<br>other closely related UAS (described below) designed for a variety of<br>missions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>高调，然而炸鸡。据说美利坚这些年炸鸡的经费都可以买一艘航母了（滑稽）。</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>System Characteristics.</em> Predator is a <strong>medium-altitude, long-endurance UAS</strong>. At 27 feet long, 7<br>feet high and with a 48-foot wingspan, it has long, thin wings and a tail like an inverted “V.” The<br>Predator typically operates at 10,000 to 15,000 feet to get the <strong>best imagery from its video<br>cameras</strong>, although it has the ability to reach a maximum altitude of 25,000 feet. Each vehicle can<br>remain on station, over 500 nautical miles away from its base, for 24 hours before returning<br>home. The Air Force’s Predator fleet is operated by the 15 th and 17 th Reconnaissance Squadrons<br>out of Creech Air Force Base, NV; the 11 th Reconnaissance Squadron provides training. A second<br>control station has been established at Whiteman AFB, MO. 104 Further, “[t]here are plans to set up<br>Predator operations at bases in Arizona, California, New York, North Dakota, and Texas.”  The<br>Air Force has about 175 Predators; the CIA reportedly owns and operates several Predators as<br>well.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Mission and Payload.</em> The Predator’s primary function is <strong>reconnaissance and target acquisition</strong> of<br>potential ground targets. To accomplish this mission, the Predator is outfitted with a 450-lb<br><strong>surveillance payload</strong>, which includes <strong>two electro-optical (E-O) cameras and one infrared (IR)<br>camera for use at night</strong>. These cameras are housed in a ball-shaped turret that can be easily seen<br>underneath the vehicle’s nose. The Predator is also equipped with a Multi-Spectral Targeting<br>System (MTS) sensor ball which adds a laser designator to the E-O/IR payload that allows the<br>Predator to track moving targets. Additionally, the Predator’s payload includes a <strong>synthetic<br>aperture radar (SAR)</strong>, which enables the UAS to “see” through inclement weather. The Predator’s<br>satellite communications provide for beyond line-of-sight operations. In 2001, as a <strong>secondary<br>function</strong>, the Predator was outfitted with the ability to carry <strong>two Hellfire missiles</strong>. Previously, the<br>Predator identified a target and relayed the coordinates to a manned aircraft, which then engaged<br>the target. The addition of this <strong>anti-tank ordnance</strong> enables the UAS to launch a precision attack on<br>a time sensitive target with a minimized “sensor-to-shoot” time cycle. Consequently, the Air<br>Force changed the Predator’s military designation from RQ-1B (reconnaissance unmanned) to the<br>MQ-1 (multi-mission unmanned).  The air vehicle launches and lands like a regular aircraft, but<br>is controlled by a pilot on the ground using a joystick.</p>

<h3 id="MQ-9-Reaper"><a href="#MQ-9-Reaper" class="headerlink" title="MQ-9 Reaper"></a>MQ-9 Reaper</h3><p>The MQ-9 Reaper, formerly the “Predator B,” is General Atomics’ follow-on to the MQ-1. The<br>Reaper is a <strong>medium- to high-altitude, long-endurance</strong> Predator optimized for surveillance, target<br>acquisition, and armed engagement. While the Reaper borrows from the overall design of the<br>Predator, the Reaper is 13 feet longer and carries a 16-foot-longer wingspan. It also features a 900<br>hp turboprop engine, which is significantly more powerful than the Predator’s <strong>115 hp engine</strong>.<br>These upgrades allow the Reaper to reach a maximum altitude of 50,000 feet, a maximum speed<br>of 225 knots, a maximum endurance of 32 hours, and a maximum range of 2,000 nautical<br>miles. However, the feature that most differentiates Reaper from its predecessor is its <strong>ordnance<br>capacity</strong>. While the Predator is outfitted to carry 2 100-pound Hellfire missiles, the Reaper now<br>can carry as many as <strong>16 Hellfires</strong>, equivalent to the Army’s Apache helicopter, or <strong>a mix of 500-<br>pound weapons and Small Diameter Bombs</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Program Status.</em> Predator–family UAS are operated as part of a system, which consists of four air<br>vehicles, a ground control station, and a primary satellite link. The unit cost in FY2009 for one<br>Predator system was approximately $20 million, while the average procurement unit cost for a<br>Reaper system was <strong>$26.8 million</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="RQ-4-Global-Hawk"><a href="#RQ-4-Global-Hawk" class="headerlink" title="RQ-4 Global Hawk"></a>RQ-4 Global Hawk</h3><p>Northrop Grumman’s RQ-4 Global Hawk has gained distinction <strong>as the largest and most<br>expensive UAS currently in operation</strong> for the Department of Defense. Global Hawk incorporates<br>a diverse surveillance payload with performance capabilities that rival or exceed most manned<br>spy planes. However, Pentagon officials and Members of Congress have become increasingly<br>concerned with the program’s burgeoning cost, which resulted in Nunn-McCurdy breaches in<br>April 2005 and April 2011.  Also, the RQ-4B Block 30 was deemed “not operationally suitable”<br>due to “low air vehicle reliability” by the office of Operational Test and Evaluation in May<br>2011.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>*System Characteristics.*At 44 feet long and weighing 26,750 lbs, Global Hawk is about as large<br>as a medium sized corporate jet. Global Hawk flies at <strong>nearly twice the altitude of commercial<br>airliners</strong> and can stay <em>aloft at 65,000 feet</em> for as long as <strong>35 hours</strong>. It can fly to a target area <strong>5,400<br>nautical miles away</strong>, loiter at 60,000 feet while monitoring an area the size of the state of Illinois<br>for 24 hours, and then return. Global Hawk was originally <strong>designed to be an autonomous</strong> drone<br>capable of taking off, flying, and landing on pre-programmed inputs to the UAV’s flight<br>computer. Air Force operators have found, however, that the UAS requires <strong>frequent intervention<br>by remote operators</strong>. The RQ-4B resembles the RQ-4A, yet features a significantly larger<br>airframe. In designing the B-model, Northrop Grumman increased the Global Hawk’s length from<br>44 feet to 48 feet and its wingspan from 116 feet to 132 feet. The expanded size enables the RQ-<br>4B to carry an extra 1000 pounds of surveillance payload.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frequent intervention, namely, it’s not a smart (automatic)<br>stuff. It’s as dummy as fuck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Mission and Payload.</em> The Global Hawk UAS has been called “**the theater commander’s around-<br>the-clock, low-hanging (surveillance) satellite.**” The UAS provides a long-dwell presence over<br>the battlespace, giving military commanders a persistent source of high-quality imagery that has<br>proven valuable in surveillance and interdiction operations. The RQ-4A’s current imagery<br>payload consists of a 2,000-lb integrated suite of sensors much larger than those found on the<br>Predator. These sensors include an <strong>all-weather SAR</strong> with Moving Target Indicator (MTI)<br>capability, an <strong>E-O digital camera and an IR sensor</strong>. As the result of a January 2002 Air Force<br>requirements summit, Northrop Grumman expanded its payload to make it a multi-intelligence air<br>vehicle. The subsequent incarnation, the RQ-4B, is outfitted with an open-system architecture<br>that enables the vehicle to carry multiple payloads, such as <strong>signals intelligence (SIGINT)</strong> and<br><strong>electronic intelligence (ELINT) sensors</strong>. Furthermore, the classified Multi-Platform Radar<br>Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) payload will be added in order to increase radar<br>capabilities. These new sensor packages will enable operators to <strong>eavesdrop</strong> on radio<br>transmissions or to identify enemy radar from extremely high altitudes. Future plans include<br>adding hyper-spectral sensors for increased imagery precision and incorporating <strong>laser<br>communications</strong> to expand information transfer capabilities. The end goal is to field a UAS that<br>will work with space-based sensors to create a <strong>“staring net”</strong> that will prevent enemies from<br>establishing <strong>a tactical surprise</strong>. In August 2003, the Federal Aviation Administration granted the<br>Global Hawk authorization to fly in U.S. civilian airspace, which further expanded the system’s<br>mission potential. This distinction, in combination with the diverse surveillance capabilities,<br>has led many officials outside the Pentagon to consider the Global Hawk an attractive candidate<br>for <strong>anti-drug smuggling and Coast Guard operations</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Program Status.</em> Developed by Northrop Grumman Corporation of Palmdale, CA, Global Hawk<br>entered low-rate initial production in February 2002. The Air Force has stated that it intends to<br>acquire 51 Global Hawks, at an expected cost of $6.6 billion for development and procurement<br>costs. As of November 2009, the Air Force possessed 7 RQ-4As and 3 RQ-4Bs. Another 32<br>Global Hawks had been authorized and appropriated through FY2011. According to the most<br>recent Selected Acquisition Report, the current average procurement unit cost for the Global<br>Hawk has reached <strong>$140.9 million</strong> in current dollars.</p>

<h3 id="BAMS"><a href="#BAMS" class="headerlink" title="BAMS"></a>BAMS</h3><p>The Navy’s Broad Area Maritime Surveillance system is based on the Global Hawk Block 20<br>airframe but with significantly different sensors from its Air Force kin. This, coupled with a<br>smaller fleet size, results in <strong>a higher unit cost</strong>. “The air service’s drone costs $27.6 million per<br>copy, compared to an expected $55 million per BAMS UAV, including its sensors and<br>communications suite…. At 68 aircraft, the BAMS fleet will be the world’s <strong>largest purchase</strong> of<br>long-endurance marinized UAVs.”</p>
<p><em>System Characteristics and Mission.</em> “BAMS … provides persistent maritime intelligence,<br>surveillance, and reconnaissance data collection and dissemination capability to the Maritime<br>Patrol and Reconnaissance Force. The MQ-4C BAMS UAS is a multi-mission system to support<br>strike, signals intelligence, and communications relay as an adjunct to the MMA/P-3 community<br>to enhance manpower, training and maintenance efficiencies worldwide.”</p>
<p>“The RQ-4 … features <strong>sensors</strong> designed to provide <strong>near worldwide coverage</strong> through a network of<br>five orbits inside and outside continental United States, with sufficient air vehicles to remain<br>airborne for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, out to ranges of 2000 nautical miles. Onboard sensors<br>will provide <strong>detection, classification, tracking and identification of maritime targets</strong> and include<br>maritime radar, electro-optical/infra-red and Electronic Support Measures systems. Additionally,<br>the RQ-4 will have a <strong>communications relay capability</strong> designed to link dispersed forces in the<br>theater of operations and serve as a node in the Navy’s FORCEnet strategy.</p>

<h3 id="MQ-8B-Fire-Scout"><a href="#MQ-8B-Fire-Scout" class="headerlink" title="MQ-8B Fire Scout"></a>MQ-8B Fire Scout</h3><p>Now in deployment, the Fire Scout was initially designed as the Navy’s choice for an unmanned<br>helicopter capable of <strong>reconnaissance, situational awareness, and precise targeting</strong>. Although the<br>Navy canceled production of the Fire Scout in 2001, Northrop Grumman’s vertical take-off UAV<br>was rejuvenated by the Army in 2003, when the Army designated the Fire Scout as the interim<br>Class IV UAV for the future combat system. The Army’s interest spurred renewed Navy funding<br>for the MQ-8, making the Fire Scout DOD’s first joint UAS helicopter.</p>
<p><em>System Characteristics and Mission.</em> Northrop Grumman based the design of the Fire Scout on a<br><strong>commercial helicopter</strong>. The RQ-8B model added a four-blade rotor to reduce the aircraft’s<br>acoustic signature. With a basic 127-pound payload, the Fire Scout can stay aloft for up to 9.5<br>hours; with the full-capacity sensor payload, endurance diminishes to <strong>roughly 6 hours</strong>. Fire Scout<br>possesses autonomous flight capabilities. The surveillance payload consists of <strong>a laser designator<br>and range finder, an IR camera and a multi-color EO camera</strong>, which when adjusted with specific<br>filters could provide mine-detection capabilities. Fire Scout also currently possesses line-of-<br>sight communication data links. Initial tests of an armed Fire Scout were conducted in 2005, and<br>the Navy expects to add “either Raytheon’s Griffin or BAE’s Advanced Precision Kill Weapon<br>System” small missiles to currently deployed Fire Scouts soon. Discussions of future missions<br>have also covered border patrol, search and rescue operations, medical resupply, and <strong>submarine<br>spotting operations</strong>.</p>

First photographed in the skies over Afghanistan, but also reportedly in<br>operation from South Korea, 150 the RQ-170 is a tailless <strong>“flying wing”</strong> stealthier than other current<br>U.S. UAS. An RQ-170 was reported to have performed surveillance and data relay related to the<br>operation against Osama bin Laden’s compound on May 1, 2011. The government of Iran claimed<br>on December 2, 2011, to be in possession of <strong>an intact RQ-170</strong> following its incursion into Iranian<br>airspace.</p>

The service has deployed the RQ-5A<br>for <strong>tactical ISR</strong> in support of numerous ground operations around the world. At one time, the<br>Army planned to acquire 52 Hunter integrated systems of eight air vehicles apiece, but the Hunter<br>program experienced some turbulence. The Army canceled full-rate production of the RQ-5A in<br>1996, but continued to use the seven systems already produced. It acquired 18 MQ-5B Hunter IIs<br>through low-rate initial production in FY2004 and FY2005. The MQ-5B’s design includes <strong>longer<br>endurance</strong> and the capability to be outfitted with <strong>anti-tank munitions</strong>. Both variants are currently<br>operated by the <strong>224 th Military Intelligence Battalion</strong> out of Fort Stewart, GA; by the 15 th Military<br>Intelligence Battalion out of Ft. Hood, TX; and by 1 st Military Intelligence Battalion out of<br>Hohenfels, Germany.</p>

<p><em>System Characteristics.</em> The RQ-5A can fly at altitudes up to <strong>15,000 feet, reach speeds of 106<br>knots, and spend up to 12 hours</strong> in the air. Weighing 1,600 pounds, it has an operating radius of<br>144 nautical miles. The MQ-5B includes an elongated wingspan of 34.3 feet up from 29.2 feet of<br>the RQ-5A and <strong>a more powerful engine</strong>, which allows the Hunter II to stay airborne for three<br>extra hours and to reach altitudes of 18,000 feet. The Hunter system consists of eight aircraft,<br>ground control systems and support devices, and launch/recovery equipment. In FY2004, the<br>final year of Hunter procurement, <strong>a Hunter system cost $26.5<br>million</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="RQ-7-Shadow"><a href="#RQ-7-Shadow" class="headerlink" title="RQ-7 Shadow"></a>RQ-7 Shadow</h3><p>The RQ-7 Shadow found a home when the Army, after a two-decade search for a suitable system,<br>selected AAI’s close range surveillance platform for its tactical unmanned aerial vehicle (TUAV)<br>program. Originally, the Army, in conjunction with the Navy explored several different UAVs for<br>the TUAV program, including the now-cancelled RQ-6 Outrider system. However, in 1997, after<br>the Navy pursued other alternatives, the Army opted for the low-cost, simple design of the RQ-7<br>Shadow 200. Having reached full production capacity and an IOC in 2002, the Shadow has<br>become the primary airborne ISR tool of numerous Army units around the world and is expected<br>to remain in service through the decade.</p>
<p><em>System Characteristics.</em> Built by AAI Corporation (now owned by Textron), the Shadow is 11 feet<br>long with a wingspan of 13 feet. It has a range of <strong>68 nautical miles</strong>, a distance picked to match<br>typical Army brigade operations, and average flight duration of five hours. Although the Shadow<br>can reach a maximum altitude of 14,000 feet, its optimum level is 8,000 feet. The Shadow is<br>catapulted from a <strong>rail-launcher</strong>, and recovered with the <strong>aid of arresting gear</strong>. The UAS also<br>possesses automatic takeoff and landing capabilities. The upgraded version, the RQ-7B Shadow,<br>features a 16-inch greater wingspan and larger fuel capacity, allowing for an extra two hours of<br>flight endurance.</p>
<p><em>Mission and Payload.</em> The Shadow provides <strong>real-time</strong> reconnaissance, surveillance, and target<br>acquisition information to the Army at the brigade level. A potential mission for the Shadow is the<br>perilous job of medical resupply. The Army is considering expanding the UAS’s traditional<br>missions to include a medical role, where several crucial items such as blood, vaccines, and fluid<br>infusion systems could be delivered to troops via parachute. For surveillance purposes, the<br>Shadow’s 60-pound payload consists of an <strong>E-O/IR sensor turret</strong>, which produces day or night<br>video and can relay data to a ground station in real-time via a line-of-sight data link. As part of<br>the Army’s Future Combat System plans, the Shadow will be outfitted with the Tactical Common<br>Data Link currently in development to network the UAS with battalion commanders, ground<br>units, and other air vehicles. The Marine Corps is considering how to arm Shadow.</p>
